🥁 1. Genre / Era Scores

These are useful prompt words that imply a tempo, swing, and groove.

Score Name	Typical BPM	Description / Feel
Boom-Bap 90s	88–96	Sparse kicks, hard snares, swingy 16th hats, occasional clap. Think DJ Premier, Tribe.
Trap Modern	130–150	Triplet/32nd hats, rolling snares, layered claps, deep 808-style kick.
West Coast G-Funk	92–100	Laid-back, wide-spaced hats, bright claps on 2/4, swing around 58–60.
Lo-Fi Chillhop	70–85	Gentle kicks, ghost snares, dusty hats, high swing, low velocity.
Jazz Brush Ride	120–180	Rides on Y, light ghost snares, subtle offbeat kick.
House / Deep House	118–124	Straight 4-on-the-floor kick, open hats on offbeats.
Techno / Minimal	120–135	Repetitive, mechanical, low swing, probability variation over time.
Dilla-esque Humanized	86–94	Extreme swing (62–65), ghost snares, off-grid hats.
Drill / UK	140	Sparse, sliding feel, syncopated hi-hats, missing snares.
Afrobeats	96–110	Offbeat snares/claps, syncopated open hats, percussive shuffle.
Reggaeton / Dem-Bow	90–100	Kick-snare “boom-ch-boom-chick” pattern, repeating groove.
🧠 2. Structural Scores (by rhythm pattern)

You can also think of “scores” as metapatterns — shapes of rhythm you can apply to any sound set.

Score Type	Concept	Description
Grid-Tight	GRID: 1/16, SWING: 50	Robotic, techno feel.
Loose Humanized	%humanize=±15ms, SWING: 60	Dilla / human feel.
Call-and-Response	Alternating Q/W vs E/R	Kick–snare motif answered by hat/click.
Syncopated Layered	Offset snares (^+1)	Creates groove tension.
Rolling Hat Engine	R@1/32 + random [p=70]	Modern trap texture.
Sparse Pocket	few Q, strong W, minimal R/T	Boom-bap simplicity.
Fills & Ghosts	%chance(20){...} mini sections	Random short fills.
Polyrhythmic Overlay	e.g. R@LEN=12	Uneven loops creating evolving texture.
Evolving Probabilistic	p=40–100 ramp	Lush, “alive” beat.
🎬 3. Cinematic / Mood Scores

For when the beat serves a scene or vibe rather than a song.

Score	Mood / Use
Tense Pulse – minimal kick, sparse hats, heartbeat pacing.	
Urban Night – slow lo-fi, brushed snare, jazzy open hats.	
Startup Montage – mid-tempo, crisp hats, layered claps.	
Slow Burn Suspense – irregular kick, off-grid hats, low velocities.	
Triumphant Groove – bright hats, hard snares, repeating 2-bar loop.	
Romantic Vinyl Dust – swingy brushes, filtered highs, gentle clap.	
Club Scene / Techno Pulse – 4/4 kicks, evolving hats, accent loops.	
Chaos Cutscene – heavy probability variation, rolls, random hits.	
🧩 4. Algorithmic / Meta Scores

Prompt concepts for generative logic or procedural rhythm.

Score	Idea
Fractal – subdivide each bar recursively (1/4 → 1/8 → 1/16 patterns).	
Markov – use probability of last hit to decide next.	
Euclidean – distribute N hits evenly over M steps.	
Swing Drift – swing varies per bar (55→65).	
Erosion / Growth – remove or add hits each loop.	
Phase Shift – offset one track slowly over time (R^+1 every 8 bars).	
Call-Response AI – generate 2 bars “call” + 2 bars “response” variation.
